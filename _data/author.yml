catchphrase:
  Iâ€™m a software engineer who likes art, writing, music,
  just trying to learn how to be a person like everyone else.

about:
  I'm Teresa. I'm a software engineer studying at the University of Southern
  California. I'm majoring in Computer Science at
  USC Viterbi School of Engineering and graduating in May 2020.
  
  I stumbled upon computer science only 4 years ago, with the hopes
  of finding meaning and impactful projects to work on. Throughout the years, I hope
  I've learned a thing or too about how to succeed in this career
  and this website is a way for me pass wisdom down and share my story.
