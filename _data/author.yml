catchphrase:
  I'm a product manager trained as a software engineer who strives to work on meaningful projects.

about:
  Hey! I'm Teresa. I'm studying computer science at the University of Southern
  California and I will be graduating in May 2020. Ever since I started pursuing work in the
  tech industry, I've done my best to learn as much as possible and work with amazing people.
  I entered college with minimal coding experience, though with the determination to
  achieve technical expertise quickly, I dove into challenges across a variety of
  settings, from hackathons, to internships, to working with non-profits, to building full-fledged
  deployed projects on my own. I've built experience ranging across engineering backend
  and systems infrastructure to designing and creating frontend projects.


  Nowadays, I'm learning and striving to be a great product manager :)


  If you have any questions, anything from getting your feet off the ground with learning
  computer science to how to start your career in product or engineering, feel free
  to reach out! I've been in your shoes, and I'm always happy to help!
