catchphrase:
  Iâ€™m a software engineer who has a passion for art, music, and writing
  and I'm a college kid learning to navigate life.

about:
  I'm Teresa. I'm studying computer science at the University of Southern
  California and I will be graduating in May 2020.


  I stumbled upon computer science only 4 years ago, with the hopes
  of finding meaning and impactful projects to work on. Throughout the years, I hope
  I've learned a thing or two about how to succeed in this career
  and this website and blog is a way for me to share my story.
