catchphrase:
  Iâ€™m a software engineer who has a passion for art, music, and writing
  and I'm a college kid learning to navigate life.

about:
  I'm Teresa. I'm studying computer science at the University of Southern
  California and I will be graduating in May 2020. Ever since I set my heart
  on pursuing tech, I've done my best to learn as much
  as possible and work with amazing people. I've only known how to code for a 
  handful of years, but since I've started, I've tried working on as many projects and teams
  as I could. Looking into the future, I really strive to be working on impactful projects
  and to be constantly learning and excited about the work I'm doing.


  If you have any questions, anything from getting your feet off the ground with learning
  computer science to how to start your career in product or engineering, feel free
  to reach out! I've been in your shoes, and I'm always happy to help :)
