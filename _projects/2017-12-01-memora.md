Memora is a desktop application that allows users to keep track of anything they wish to remember in their daily activities. <!--more-->
Anything from important news stories to anniversaries to thoughts, memora can keep track of it all on its calendars. Share calendars with multiple people as well so you can share memories with family, friends, and others.

**Created December 2017 for CSCI 201**

**Github**: [Frontend repository](https://github.com/nishelat/memora-frontend) and [backend repository](https://github.com/nishelat/memora-backend)

## Motivation
At any age, we encounter events in our lives that evoke strong emotions, whether that would be spending time with family or friends or accomplishing a long-term goal. Yet it is so easy to forget these memories that mean so much to us and continue on with our ever-busy lives. Memora is meant to digitally scrapbook our past and open up memory sharing with groups we care about.
