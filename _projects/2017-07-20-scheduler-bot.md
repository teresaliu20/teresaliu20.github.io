Scheduler Bot is a Slack bot that plans meetings and reminders for slack teams. <!--more--> Simply start a conversation with our bot, asking to set a reminder or meeting along with a date time and invites, and the bot will create the Google Calendar event for you after asking for confirmation. This bot is meant to make anything from scheduling one-on-one coffee or lunch breaks to reminders for deadlines much easier by efficiently integrating the process into Slack conversations.
