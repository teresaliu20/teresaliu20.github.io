If you're reading this, then I'm super impressed that you stumbled upon my website right as its undergoing construction these few days! Please say hi to me and let me know what you think about this blog so far :) 

I will be finishing up this website and blog around the beginning of January. I will be adding in the rest of my projects, polishing up the content, and fixing little bugs.

I plan to write regularly about the field of computer science, career advice, and generally my journey as a software engineer. Stay tuned for my first blog post!
